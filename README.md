# Trivia

This project was developed during the web development course at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/). It was developed by a team formed by
[Pedro Fonseca](https://github.com/PedroFonseca13),
[Jorge Dorio](https://github.com/JorgeDorio),
[Tadeo Salaviaw](https://github.com/SALAVIAW), and myself.
The project is a Trivia game. We used the free API [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/)
to feed our front end project. The main goal here was to put in practice what we had learned of React and Redux.
